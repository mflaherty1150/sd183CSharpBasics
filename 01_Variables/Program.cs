We will see all of these things more as we go, but before that let's have you complete a short task.

Your challenge is to change the way we gather the firstName variable's value. Instead of assigning it in the code,

Make sure to inform the user with a prompt before you just ask them to enter information otherwise they will not 
know what is expected.
